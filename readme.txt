Dynamic popup contact button with dashboard inbox  for WooCommerce & other pages.


== Description ==

= ListPress Inbox =
You will never miss important emails because messages are also visible at dashboard with inbox support. You can also reply from dashboard using your own official email address. It also grabs user information like IP address and page URL from where the form is submitted. 

= No Captcha Required =
No more captcha (security check) required for this form. It is dynamic in nature and detect robots to prevent from spam mails. Security check will be our major priority.

= Dynamic =

In addition of default basic form you can change look & feel of form using your own CSS script. With little HTML knowledge, let you add extra fields in a way you want. You can also use your own javascript logic to control the form input before it is submitted.

= Shortcode =
Button can also be inserted using shortcode. 
Just keep shortcode as [listpress] where ever you want and configure settings.
The settings can also be overridden by using parameters in shortcode. This way each button can have own form. For example: One button can work as feedback form and other form as product inquiry.

 * User Post Gallery - UPG (Dynamically place "report spam" or "feedback button" at UPG preview page.). Ability to send mail directly to upg-post submitter.
